# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   Python is an open-source, high-level, general-purpose programming language that has gained immense popularity among developers. Here are some key features that contribute to its widespread adoption:

Intuitive Syntax: Python’s syntax resembles natural English, making it easy to learn and read, especially for beginners entering the programming world.
Human-Friendly: Its syntax is easy to write, read, and debug, which accelerates development.
Rich Standard Library: Python provides an extensive standard library, covering a wide range of functionalities.
Abundant Libraries and Modules: Beyond the standard library, Python offers a vast ecosystem of well-documented additional libraries and modules. These cater to various needs, from data analysis to web development.
Open Source: Python is free and open-source, encouraging collaboration and continuous improvement.
Strong Community Support: A large community actively develops, enhances, and expands Python, ensuring its relevance and robustness.
Now, let’s explore some real-world use cases where Python shines:

Data Analysis and Data Science: Python is a go-to language for data professionals. It’s used for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib empower data scientists and analysts1.
Machine Learning and AI: Python’s simplicity and powerful libraries (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn) make it ideal for building machine learning models and AI applications.
Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask allow developers to create robust web applications efficiently.
Internet of Things (IoT): Python’s lightweight nature and support for microcontrollers make it suitable for IoT projects.
Legacy App Modernization: Python helps modernize legacy applications by integrating new features or migrating them to more efficient platforms2.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   

Install Python:
Visit the official Python download page.
Choose the latest stable version (e.g., Python 3.12.4) and download the Windows installer (64-bit or 32-bit, depending on your system).
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to check the box that says “Add Python X.Y to PATH” during installation1.
Verify Python Installation:
Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
Type python --version and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version (e.g., “Python 3.12.4”)2.
Set Up a Virtual Environment:
Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
Run the following command to create a virtual environment named “myenv”:
python -m venv myenv

Activate the virtual environment:
For Command Prompt: myenv\Scripts\activate
For PowerShell: myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
You’ll see the virtual environment name in your prompt (e.g., (myenv)).
Now you can install packages specific to your project within this isolated environment.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
print("Hello, World!")

print() Function:
The print() function is used to display text or values in the console.
Inside the parentheses, we provide the string we want to print (in this case, “Hello, World!”).
String:
"Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.
Strings represent text and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.
Comments (not used in this example):
Comments start with the # symbol and are ignored by the Python interpreter.
They allow developers to add explanations or notes within the code.
4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Integer (int):
Represents whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10).
Example:

age = 25

Floating-Point Number (float):
Represents decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
Example:

pi = 3.14

String (str):
Represents text (enclosed in single or double quotes).
Example:

name = "Alice"

Boolean (bool):
Represents either True or False.
Example:

is_student = True

Now, let’s create a script that uses these data types:

Python

# Integer
age = 25
print(f"Age: {age}")

# Floating-point
pi = 3.14
print(f"Pi: {pi}")

# String
name = "Alice"
print(f"Name: {name}")

# Boolean
is_student = True
print(f"Is student? {is_student}")
5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. They control the flow of your program by executing specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. Here are some types of conditional statements in Python:

if Statement:
The if statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is met.
Syntax:


if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is true

Example:


number = 10
if number > 0:
    print("Number is positive")
print("This statement always executes")
Output:
Number is positive
This statement always executes

if-else Statement:
The if-else statement combines an additional block of code (the else block) that executes when the if condition is false.
Syntax:


if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is true
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is false

Example:


x = 3
if x == 4:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
Output:
No

Nested if..else Statement:
A nested if..else statement contains an if-else statement inside another if statement.
Example:


letter = "A"
if letter == "B":
    print("letter is B")
else:
    if letter == "C":
        print("letter is C")
    else:
        if letter == "A":
            print("letter is A")
        else:
            print("letter isn't A, B, or C")
Output:
letter is A

if-elif-else Statement:
The if-elif-else statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.
Example:


letter = "A"
if letter == "B":
    print("letter is B")
elif letter == "C":
    print("letter is C")
elif letter == "A":
    print("letter is A")
else:
    print("letter isn't A, B, or C")
Output:
letter is A

Ternary Expression:
A concise way to write conditional statements in a single line.
Example:

result = "Pass" if score >= 50 else "Fail"

Loops:
Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Here’s an example of a for loop:

for Loop:
The for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., a range, list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
Syntax:


for item in iterable:
    # Code to execute for each item

Example with a range:


for i in range(25, 29):
    print(i)
Output:
25
26
27
28

Example with a list:


my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for x in my_list:
    print(x)
Output:
apple
banana
cherry

Similar examples can be done with tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They allow you to organize your code, make it more modular, and avoid repetition. Here are some reasons why functions are useful:

Modularity: Functions break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. You can then reuse these pieces across different parts of your program.
Reusability: Once you define a function, you can call it multiple times with different inputs. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.
Readability: Functions make your code more readable by encapsulating logic and providing descriptive names. This improves code maintainability and collaboration.
Abstraction: Functions allow you to hide implementation details. Users of the function only need to know what it does, not how it does it.

example:
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Adds two numbers and returns the result.
    """
    return a + b

# Example usage:
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 8

In this example:

We define a function called add_numbers that accepts two parameters (a and b).
Inside the function, we use the return statement to compute the sum of a and b.
We call the function with the arguments 5 and 3, and store the result in the result variable.
Finally, we print the sum using print("Sum:", result).

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
Lists:
Definition: Lists are ordered collections of elements. They can hold various data types (integers, strings, objects) and allow duplicates.
Access: You can access list elements using indices (starting from 0).
Mutability: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their contents after creation.
Example:

my_list = [10, 20, 30, "hello"]
print(my_list[1])  # Accessing element at index 1 (20)
my_list.append(40)  # Adding a new element

Dictionaries:
Definition: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key maps to a value.
Access: You retrieve values using keys (not indices).
Mutability: Dictionaries are also mutable.
Example:

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Wonderland"}
print(my_dict["age"])  # Accessing value using key ("age")
my_dict["occupation"] = "Engineer"  # Adding a new key-value pair

Now, let’s create a script that demonstrates these concepts:


# Creating a list of numbers
number_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
person_info = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "Metropolis"
}

# Accessing elements
print("Third number in the list:", number_list[2])
print("Age of the person:", person_info["age"])

# Modifying elements
number_list[1] = 10
person_info["city"] = "Gotham"

# Adding new elements
number_list.append(6)
person_info["occupation"] = "Detective"

# Displaying updated lists and dictionaries
print("Updated number list:", number_list)
print("Updated person info:", person_info)

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully manage errors during program execution. It helps prevent your program from crashing when unexpected events occur. Let’s explore how to use try, except, and finally blocks:

try and except:
The try block contains code that might raise an exception.
If an exception occurs within the try block, Python jumps to the corresponding except block.
You can handle specific exceptions (e.g., ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) or use a generic except to catch any exception.
Example:

def divide(x, y):
    try:
        result = x / y
        print("Result:", result)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

divide(10, 2)  # Result: 5.0
divide(10, 0)  # Cannot divide by zero
divide("hello", 2)  # An error occurred: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'

else block:
The else block executes if no exception occurs in the try block.
It’s useful for handling code that should run only when no exceptions are raised.
Example:

def divide(x, y):
    try:
        result = x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero")
    else:
        print("Division result:", result)

divide(10, 2)  # Division result: 5.0

finally block:
The finally block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not.
It’s commonly used for cleanup tasks (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).
Example:

def open_file(filename):
    try:
        file = open(filename, "r")
        content = file.read()
        print("File content:", content)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found")
    finally:
        file.close()  # Always close the file

open_file("sample.txt")  # File content: Hello, world!
open_file("nonexistent.txt")  # File 'nonexistent.txt' not found

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
Modules:
A module is a file containing Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other Python files or programs.
Modules allow you to organize code logically and reuse it across different parts of your application.
To use a module, you simply import it using the import statement. For example:

import math

Packages:
A package is a collection of related modules organized in a directory hierarchy.
Packages allow you to group related functionality together, making it easier to manage large projects.
A package must contain an __init__.py file (even if it’s empty) to be recognized as a package.
You can arrange modules within a package in subdirectories.
Example of importing a module from a package:

from mypackage import mymodule

Using the math module:
The math module provides mathematical functions and constants.
Example: Calculating the square root of 25:


import math
result = math.sqrt(25)
print("Square root of 25:", result)


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
Reading from a File:
To read from a file, you can use the open() function with the appropriate file mode (e.g., 'r' for read mode).
The with statement ensures that the file is properly closed after reading.
Example: Reading the contents of a file and printing them to the console:


filename = "sample.txt"
with open(filename, "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

Writing to a File:
To write to a file, use the open() function with the 'w' mode (write mode).
Existing content is overwritten when you write to an existing file.
Example: Writing a list of strings to a file:

strings_to_write = ["Hello", "World", "Python"]
output_filename = "output.txt"
with open(output_filename, "w") as output_file:
    for string in strings_to_write:
        output_file.write(string + "\n")
